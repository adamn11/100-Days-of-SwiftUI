# 100-Days-of-SwiftUI
This repo is meant to show my progress in learning iOS Development using HackingWithSwift's [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui). This will be split by individual projects instead of days. Inside each folder will contain my code along with a readme of my notes/thoughts about the day's topic/project. This is mainly used for my own note taking on the day's topic as well as to solidify my understanding.

Any comments and suggestions on improving my code would be greatly appreciated!

## Projects
I will include a GIF showing the finalized projects here. Currently in progress...
